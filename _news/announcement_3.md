#### What Are Design Patterns<
>
Unlike off-the-shelf functions or libraries, design patterns cannot be simply copied and pasted into your program. Rather, they represent general concepts for solving specific problems. By understanding the details of a pattern, you can implement a solution that best suits the unique requirements of your program. Most patterns are described in a formal manner to enable reproducibility across various contexts

#### Distinction from Algorithms
>
It is important to distinguish design patterns from algorithms, as both concepts offer solutions to known problems. While an algorithm outlines a set of clear actions to achieve a goal, a design pattern provides a higher-level description of a solution. The code implementing the same pattern may vary across different programs.<br>
To draw an analogy, an algorithm is akin to a cooking recipe, with well-defined steps to attain an outcome. On the other hand, a design pattern resembles a blueprint, offering insights into the desired result and its features while allowing flexibility in the implementation order.

#### Generall classification of design pattern
>
<b>Creational patterns</b> deal with object creation and initialization. They provide a way to create objects while hiding the creation logic, rather than instantiating objects directly using a new operator.<br>
<b>Structural patterns</b> describe how to use objects to form larger structures. They are concerned with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures.<br>
<b>Behavioral patterns</b> define how objects interact and communicate. They are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

#### Conclusion

Understanding design patterns empowers software developers to approach recurring problems with proven and effective solutions. By leveraging these customizable blueprints, developers can streamline their design processes and enhance the overall quality and maintainability of their code.
